Hi, I'm Sirisak Chantanate ðŸ‘‹

A passionate Software Engineer on a mission to make AI accessible and genuinely useful.

My journey through tech, from full-stack web development to exploring low-level languages like Rust, has led me to my true passion: **bringing AI to life through practical applications.**

ðŸš€ This GitHub is my digital workshop. My goal is to build and share open-source **AI-powered web apps** and **automation tools** that are not only powerful but also easy for others to use and adapt.

Find a project that sparks your interest? Feel free to use it! And if it helps you out, a coffee would be a wonderful way to show your support and fuel the next creation. ðŸ¤“
