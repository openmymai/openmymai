### Hi there, I'm Sirisak Chantanate ðŸ‘‹

I build intelligent, scalable systems from the ground up. With over 20 years of experience that began at the core network layer (CCIE #18148), my career has been dedicated to architecting and implementing robust, large-scale solutions.

Today, I leverage that deep foundation to build modern, AI-powered applications. My expertise spans:
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Designing asynchronous, event-driven systems on microservices (Docker, Kubernetes) for both Enterprise and Service Provider environments.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Creating user-facing applications with React and Node.js.
- **AI & Data Science:** Developing high-impact business intelligence solutions using advanced statistical algorithms and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow.

My current focus is on channeling this experience into creating open-source **AI-powered web apps** and **AI automation tools** that others can use and learn from.
